                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) glasses have become widely accessible, however, their one size fits all approach often limits their effectiveness. This study explores a novel design for customizable CVD glasses that use bespoke 3D printed colored flat lenses in order to compensate for individual deficits in color perception. The system employs alcohol dyes to color the lenses in order to compensate for the lack of perception of that color in the individual, aiming to bring the perception of that color up to normal levels by "forcing in" more of that light.</p>

                <div class="two-column">
                    <div>
                        <p>Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) occurs when someone is missing one of three color detecting cones in their eyes.</p>
                        <p>To solve this problem, researchers have developed CVD glasses, with the aim of improving the color vision of people with CVD. The issues are that current CVD glasses are "one size fits all", and usually very expensive. Not only does the "One size fits all" approach lead to CVD glasses being ineffective for the majority of the CVD population, but the high price means that many people can not afford CVD glasses regardless.</p>
                        <p>CVD affects roughly 4.25% or 344 million people world wide.</p>
                        <p>CVD can prevent people from getting jobs such as being a pilot, doctor, chef, electrician, or anything that involves color detection. Additionally, people with CVD can struggle to determine when fruit is ripe, meat is cooked adequately, and when food has gone bad. These can pose serious health risks, which is why developing adequate CVD lenses is important.</p>

                <p>To solve the issue of having expensive, ineffective CVD glasses, our design uses interchangeable, 3d printed, green lenses. The glasses consists of one lens on each eye, that is dyed with a mixture of green alcohol dye and 91% isopropyl alcohol. The higher the concentration of isopropyl alcohol, the weaker the green color will be, and vice-versa. By using resin and cheap alcohol dyes to make the lenses, our CVD glasses are adjustable, cheap, and can be fabricated at home.</p>

                    <p>We hypothesize that by using 3d printable resin and cheap alcohol dye, we can mitigate the effects of CVD in individuals with deuteranomaly.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, we expect to find an optimal dye percentage to alleviate deuteranomaly by examining the Ishihara and FM100 results across multiple trials using statistical means. Our project's success would represent a significant advance in CVD glasses, and usher in a new era of bespoke CVD glasses that are more effective and accessible to more people. We hope to make our glasses as widespread and accessible as offerings like prescription glasses, helping those with CVD live their lives to the fullest.</p>
