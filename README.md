# Interactive Symposium Poster: Mitigating the Effects of Colorblindness

This repository contains an interactive web version of the symposium poster "Mitigating the Effects of Colorblindness using Alcohol Dyed 3D Printed Lenses" by Julien Le Teigner and Tarushv C. Kosgi from AOS Jr Research.

## Project Overview

This interactive poster presents research on a novel approach to creating customized colorblindness-correcting lenses using 3D printing and alcohol dyes. The website includes:

- Full poster content
- Interactive colorblindness simulation
- Lens effect simulator
- Before/after image comparisons
- Interactive Ishihara test examples
- 3D models of the proposed lenses

## Getting Started

### View Online

The poster is hosted on GitHub Pages at: [https://tarushvkodes.github.io/interactivesymposter](https://tarushvkodes.github.io/interactivesymposter)
