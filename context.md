# Development Plan for Interactive Symposium Poster

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for creating an interactive website to showcase the symposium poster "Mitigating the Effects of Colorblindness using Alcohol Dyed 3D Printed Lenses" by Julien Le Teigner and Tarushv C. Kosgi.

## Technical Specifications
- **Platform**: GitHub Pages
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no server-side technologies)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop friendly

## Website Structure

### 1. Main Components
- **Header Section**: Title, authors, and affiliated institution
- **Navigation Bar**: For jumping to different poster sections
- **Abstract Section**: Brief overview of the project
- **Introduction Section**: Background on CVD and the project's goals
- **Methodology Section**: Details on experimental setup and procedures
- **Results Section**: Placeholder for future results
- **Conclusion Section**: Summary and implications of the research
- **Citations/Acknowledgements**: Academic references and credits

### 2. Interactive Features
- **Interactive CVD Simulation**: Allow users to see how the world looks with different types of colorblindness
- **Lens Effect Simulation**: Interactive tool demonstrating how different dye concentrations might affect vision
- **Before/After Toggle**: Show images with/without simulated lenses
- **Ishihara Test Demo**: Interactive Ishihara test examples
- **3D Lens Model Viewer**: Interactive 3D model of the proposed lenses
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts for displaying future data results

### 3. Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Accessible color palette, ironically designed to be visible to colorblind users
- **Typography**: Clean, academic style with good readability
- **Layout**: Responsive grid layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Structure and Content
- Set up HTML structure
- Implement responsive CSS layout
- Add poster content
- Set up GitHub Pages deployment

### Phase 2: Interactive Features
- Develop colorblindness simulation tool
- Create lens effect simulator 
- Implement 3D model viewer
- Add navigation and smooth scrolling functionality

### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization
- Add animations and transitions
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Cross-browser testing

## Technical Considerations
- Use of HTML Canvas API for color simulations
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no dependencies required)
- Optimized images for faster loading
- SVG graphics where appropriate

## Future Enhancements
- Add real data visualizations when results become available
- Enable user to upload their own images for colorblindness simulation
- Create downloadable resources about the research
